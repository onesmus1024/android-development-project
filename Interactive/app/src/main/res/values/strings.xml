In this practical you learn more about the activity
        lifecycle. The lifecycle is the set of states
        an activity can be in during its entire lifetime,
        from when it\'s created to when it\'s destroyed
        and the system reclaims its resources. As a user navigates
        between activities in your
        app (as well as into and out of your app),
        activities transition between different states
        in their lifecycles.</string>
